<p>FLEGT IMM sources EU import data from the <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/estat-navtree-portlet-prod/BulkDownloadListing" target="_blank" rel="noopener">COMEXT bulk download facility.</a></p>
<p>The COMEXT data harvesting and validation system used to generate the data for the 1<sup>st</sup> edition of the dashboard was developed internally by the IMM and draws from many years analysis of COMEXT data which indicates that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Reporting of value is more consistent than reporting of tonnage which in turn is more consistent than reporting of volumes (i.e. cubic meters, square meters etc).</li>
<li>&ldquo;Consistency&rdquo; in this context implies that data tends to fall within reasonable upper and lower bounds and not to vary erratically and in ways that are not readily explained by other sources of market information.</li>
<li>Tonnage data for most products varies in consistent and predictable ways with the volumetric data. This is to be expected as products within the same product group should have similar density (i.e. mass per unit of volume).</li>
<li>Euro values per unit of tonnage tend to be quite tightly clustered for products at the CN 8-digit level across the whole of the EU so that outliers can be readily identified.</li>
</ul>
<p>The starting assumption of the validation procedure is that all value data published by COMEXT is accurate and should not be changed. Changes are only made where necessary to tonnage data and volumetric data where this falls outside &ldquo;reasonable&rdquo; boundaries identified by comparing price per tonnage and tonnage per volumetric unit.</p>
<p>Boundaries are set for each product group at CN 8-digit level through statistical analysis of all data across the EU in the decade 2007 to 2016. EU-wide data is used to identify boundaries with no attempt to refine these boundaries for individual EU member states or separately for import and export flows.</p>
<p>Boundaries are defined from statistical analysis of EU wide data from 2007 to 2016 as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>the 5% and 95% quantile set the boundaries for euro value per tonne.</li>
<li>the 25% and 75% quantile set the boundaries for tonne per volumetric unit.</li>
</ul>
<p>The use of narrower boundaries for weight per volumetric unit is justified because this relationship is physical (i.e. it refers to density) which should not vary significantly within a product group. However, there is no physical relationship between price and tonnage &ndash; a product with very low mass can be very expensive and vice-versa &ndash; and therefore the boundaries for excluding outliers should be wider.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Each month the algorithm is used to check the data for each individual trade flow (defined by a unique combination of product group at CN 8-digit level, import or export flow, EU reporting country, and partner country). The algorithm is applied to all flows for products in CN chapters 44, 45, 47, and 48, and wood-based furniture in chapter 94. Typically, around 50,000 import flows and 85,000 export flows need to be validated each month.</p>
<p>The process begins by checking for each individual flow whether euro value per tonne is within the defined bounds. If data is outside the bounds, tonnage is amended so that the unit price is equal to the closest upper or lower boundary. If value data is present but tonnage data absent, tonnage is set to the EU-wide median value of all data for the specific product during the 2007-2016 period.</p>
<p>Once the tonnage data has been checked, the algorithm checks the volumetric unit (which may be m3, m2 etc depending on the product group) to assess whether it lies within boundaries defined by the tonnage (i.e. it has &ldquo;reasonable&rdquo; density). Again outliers, where they exist, are corrected to the boundary rather than to the median density for the product group, to reduce the size of the amendment. Supplementary unit data is only estimated from median density where COMEXT data is entirely absent.</p>
<p>The combined effect of using wide boundaries for value per tonne and amending outliers in tonnage data to the closest boundary value rather than to median value, is that changes to the raw tonnage data contained in the COMEXT data are quite rare and conservative.</p>
<p>In contrast, the narrower boundaries allowed for tonnes per volumetric unit mean that changes to the Comext volumetric data are quite frequent and often large. However, the system ensures that there is always a close link between the amended volumetric unit data and the more accurate and physically related tonnage data.</p>
<p>All volumetric data presented in the dashboard is converted to roundwood equivalent RWE volume in cubic meters to ensure consistent reporting between product groups. Details of RWE conversion factors used by IMM are contained in the file imm_rwe_conversion_factors_mar_2018.xlsx</p>
<p><strong>Phased introduction of new data cleaning algorithm in 2018</strong></p>
<p>While the COMEXT data harvesting and cleaning procedures developed internally by IMM are reasonably robust, there are weaknesses. For example, due to heavy reliance on time-consuming manual procedures to calculate price per tonnage boundaries these are not regularly adjusted. The system would also benefit from more extensive peer review. For this reason, IMM will be transferring to a new more automated and publicly accessible data validation system later in 2018 which, amongst other improvements will allow for more frequent calculation of boundaries to reflect the latest available data.</p>
