<p>This dashboard provides access to and analysis of statistical data on EU imports of timber, paper and pulp from countries that are implementing or negotiating a <a href="http://www.euflegt.efi.int/vpa" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FLEGT Voluntary Partnership Agreement</a> with the EU and other countries supplying tropical timber products to the EU.</p>
<p>The dashboard has been developed by the <a href="http://www.flegtimm.eu" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FLEGT Independent Market Monitor (IMM)</a>. Funded by the EU and managed by the <a href="http://www.itto.int" target="_blank" rel="noopener">International Tropical Timber Organization (ITTO)</a>, the IMM&rsquo;s role is to use trade flow analysis and market research to independently assess trade and market impacts of FLEGT Voluntary Partnership Agreements (VPAs) in the EU and partner countries.</p>
<p>The data is derived from <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/international-trade-in-goods/data/focus-on-comext" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Eurostat COMEXT</a> compiled and validated by IMM.</p>
<p>Trade flows can be explored and relevant data downloaded (as a csv file) by selecting either:</p>
<ul>
<li>The VPA Partner country grouping (whether FLEGT licensing of VPA implementing or negotiating)</li>
<li>The individual VPA partner country</li>
<li>The whole of the EU or individual EU member country</li>
<li>The product grouping or a specific product</li>
</ul>
